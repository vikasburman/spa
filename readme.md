spa - Simple Passwords App
===

A simple, smart, secure, and sufficient portable app to store all your passwords.

This one is a single page app, literally. There is only one file "spa.html" that has it all and it runs locally on any new age browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, FireFox, Safari, IE 10, etc.). Additionally, it comes with a shell environment for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms as well. 

The sole purpose of this app is to store access information to various digital assets that everyone of us has in abundance nowadays. Along with storing passwords (and history of it) it also has provision to store associated information that comes with it. E.g., account id, access url, security questions (and answers), and dated notes to name a few. Check out the given demo file to get ideas.

You can organize access information in various categories and sub-categories and when that does not seem to working, add multiple tags that help you find information later. A fast and efficient free-text search (on any field) can still find any information irrespective of categories and tags associated with it. If you want you can even cross-link information pieces to feed "See Also" feature. 

**IMPORTANT** No information from your data file is *ever* uploaded, downloaded or transferred to any website whatsoever. This can be verified in the app code.

To start using, [download the latest release](https://github.com/vikasburman/spa/releases/tag/v0.9.3), unzip it in any local folder or flash drive and start using right away by opening the app using OS specific startup shell script (e.g., spa-win.bat on Windows OS).
